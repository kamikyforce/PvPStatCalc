### Critical Strike Rating
```
Critical Strike % = Critical Strike Rating ÷ 45.91
```
- **Formula Source**: Official Blizzard Combat Rating System (3.3.5a)
- **Example**: 1000 Rating = 21.78% Crit
- **Notes**: Applies to both melee and ranged attacks

### Hit Rating
```
Physical Hit % = Hit Rating ÷ 32.79
Spell Hit % = Hit Rating ÷ 26.23
```
- **Formula Source**: WoWWiki Combat Rating Documentation (2010)
- **Physical Hit Cap**: 8% vs Raid Bosses (263 Rating), 5% vs Players (164 Rating)
- **Spell Hit Cap**: 17% vs Raid Bosses (446 Rating), 4% vs Players (105 Rating)

### Expertise Rating
```
Expertise Points = Expertise Rating ÷ 32.79
Dodge/Parry Reduction % = Expertise Points × 0.25
```
- **Formula Source**: Elitist Jerks Theorycrafting (2010)
- **Expertise Cap**: 26 Points (6.5%) vs Players and Raid Bosses
- **Notes**: Each expertise point reduces dodge and parry chance by 0.25%

```
- **Formula Source**: Post-3.1 Combat Rating Changes
- **Notes**: Effectiveness increased by 25% in patch 3.1.0
- **Cap**: 100% (1399 Rating) - Extremely rare to reach

### Resilience Rating (PvP)
```
// PvE Formula (Crit Reduction)
Crit Reduction % = Resilience Rating ÷ 81.97

// PvP Formula (Damage Reduction)
PvP Damage Reduction % = Resilience Rating ÷ 47.28
```
- **Formula Source**: Arena Junkies PvP Theorycrafting (2010)
- **Notes**: Two separate effects - crit reduction affects all sources, damage reduction only affects player damage
- **Typical Values**: 1000+ Resilience Rating for serious PvP

## Primary Attribute Conversions

### Agility (Feral Druid Specific)
```
// Attack Power Conversion
Attack Power from Agility = Agility × 1

// Critical Strike Conversion
Critical Strike % from Agility = Agility ÷ 63.5

// Armor Conversion
Armor from Agility = Agility × 2
```
- **Formula Source**: Feral Druid Mechanics Documentation (2010)
- **Notes**: Agility is the primary stat for Feral Druids
- **Scaling**: Linear scaling at all gear levels

### Strength
```
Attack Power from Strength = Strength × 2
```
- **Formula Source**: Universal WoW Mechanics
- **Notes**: Secondary stat for Feral Druids, less valuable than Agility

### Stamina
```
Health from Stamina = Stamina × 10
```
- **Formula Source**: Level 80 Health Scaling
- **Notes**: Constant 10:1 ratio at max level

## Damage Calculations

### Attack Power to DPS
```
DPS Increase = Attack Power ÷ 14
```
- **Formula Source**: Core WoW Combat Mechanics
- **Notes**: 14 Attack Power = 1 DPS for all physical damage

### Critical Strike Damage
```
Critical Hit Damage = Base Damage × 2.0
```
- **Formula Source**: Default Critical Strike Multiplier
- **Notes**: Can be modified by talents and abilities
